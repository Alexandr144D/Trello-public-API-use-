Use your personal KEY and TOKEN.
Trello provides it to each user.
If you dont have, then go to the Trello site and Log In.
After that you will be able to generate you own API KEY and TOKEN for Trello,
switching to this link "https://trello.com/app-key/"

Now you can use your KEY and TOKEN in order to surf this small app :)
